The gnupg2-as-gpg meta-package provides a gpg command that actually
runs gpg2 from the security/gnupg2 package.  This is achieved by
providing the necessary meta-data for pkg_alternatives(8) from the
pkgtools/pkg_alternatives package.

The pkgtools/pkg_alternatives package must be also installed, but
this package intentionally does not depend on it.
